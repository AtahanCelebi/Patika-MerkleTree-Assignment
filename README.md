## Hands on Task: Merkle Tree Root Calculator on Rust

Firstly, we should understand what is Merkle Tree and how it works well. In order to do this, please research about [merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) and 
watch [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6nEPaE7KZ8) carefully.

Our main purpose is that take inputs from txt files, hash them and calculate the root.
Example txt file looks like:
```txt
